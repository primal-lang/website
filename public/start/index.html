        <h4 class="text-white start-title">What is primal?</h4>

        <p class="text-white">
          Primal is a minimalist, lightweight, functional programming language that is designed to be simple and easy to
          learn. It is inspired by Lambda Calculus, a mathematical formalism that is used to define functions and
          perform computations.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white">
          It is a declarative language, which means that it focuses on what should be done rather than how it should
          be done. This makes it easier to read and understand, especially for beginners.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white">
          It is free and open source. It's available under the MIT license, which means that you can use it for any
          purpose, commercial or non-commercial, without any restrictions. You can also modify the source code and
          distribute it as you see fit.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white">
          It is still under development, so there may be bugs and missing features. If you encounter any issues, please
          report them on <a href="https://github.com/primal-lang/sdk/issues/new" class="custom-link"
            target="_blank">GitHub</a>. If you have any suggestions or ideas for improvement, please let us know by
          sending us feedback using the <a href="https://primal-lang.org/feedback" class="custom-link">form</a>.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-white start-title">Goal</h4>
        <p class="text-white">
          Its goal is to be used primarily for educational purposes. It aims to teach programming concepts without the
          complexity of more advanced languages. It emphasizes simplicity and minimal syntax, making it a good choice
          for beginners who are learning the fundamentals of programming. It's not intended to be used in production
          environments, but it can be used for small scripts.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-white start-title">Technical envelope</h4>
        <p class="text-white">
          The language has the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <ul class="text-white">
          <li>Lazy evaluated</li>
          <li>Untyped</li>
          <li>Single threaded</li>
          <li>Expression oriented</li>
          <li>Interpreted</li>
          <li>Interactive</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="text-white start-title">Design</h4>

        Everything in Primal is a function.
        Function can (and should) be composed.
        Function cannot be overloaded (i.e. only one function with a given name can exist in a program).
        Currently there are no operators. Instead, the language offers a function with equivalent functionality (e.g.
        the sum function is the equivalent for the + operator).

        Function name format: [a-zA-Z]+[a-zA-Z_]+
        Parameter name format: ???



        Explain
        * error Handling
        * Syntax rules
        * Language constructs (no loops, only declarations)


        Explain main function. It's optional. Has no arguments

        <h4 class="text-white start-title">Typing system</h4>
        <p class="text-white">
          Primal has a dynamic runtime type checking. This means that users cannot explicitly declare types for
          parameters, return values, or variables in the code. Instead, the system performs type checks during execution
          to ensure that values match the expected types when passed to functions or operations.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white">
          This approach allows for flexibility and ease of use but relies on runtime checks to catch type-related
          errors, which can lead to errors that are only caught during execution.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-white start-title">Runtime</h4>
        <p class="text-white">
          Primal is an interpreted language. The compiler translates the source code into an intermediate representation
          that is then executed by the interpreter. The interpreter is responsible for executing the intermediate
          representation and producing the output of the program. This allows for fast development and testing cycles
          since changes to the source code can be quickly compiled and executed without the need for a separate build
          step.
